# CS313-NodeJS-App

This express.js application was built for a school assignment. 

## World Cup History

This is a simple express.js application to retrieve World Cup history data. This application uses a Heroku database seeded by myself. The work is still in progress.

## Motivation
Because most sources will have cluttered interfaces, I decided to create a SPA using a side menu. Users can easily retrieve simple data such as the final match result for each World Cup.
